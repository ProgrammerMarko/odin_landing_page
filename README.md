# Odin Landing Page

A responsive landing page built as part of [The Odin Project â€“ Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page). This project focuses on applying core HTML and CSS skills to recreate a professional webpage layout from a design reference. It demonstrates the use of **Flexbox**, visual hierarchy, and consistent styling to build a clean, structured interface. The goal is to strengthen understanding of page composition and design implementation - serving as a foundation for future front-end projects. **Page is not mobile/tablet resposive. How to handle different screen sizes will be covered later in the curriculum!**

## Technologies used:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- **Flexbox**
- Git & GitHub for version control
- GitHub Pages for deployment
